# 扫雷 Minesweeper
扫雷是经典的 Windows 游戏的 iOS 版，它的与众不同之处是一个方块周围的雷理论上多达 8 个，而不是 4 个。

Minesweeper is an iOS version of the classical PC game - Minesweeper.
In the game, you can set warnings for mines (tap and drag) or confirm safe areas (simply tap). If you are unlucky and run into a mine, the game is over and you can restart immediately. The warning of each grid is a sign of the number of mines nearby (in a 3*3 grid matrix).

Hope you enjoy the game. By the way, this project is purely coded instead of visualized using storyboards.
