# Minesweeper
Minesweeper is an iOS version of the classical PC game - Minesweeper.

In the game, you can set warnings for mines (tap and drag) or confirm safe areas (simply tap). If you are unlucky and run into a mine, the game is over and you can restart immediately. The warning of each grid is a sign of the number of mines nearby (in a 3*3 grid matrix).

Hope you enjoy the game. By the way, this project is purely coded instead of visualized using storyboards.

**I highly recommend you watch the screen record pictures to understand what I am talking about...**
